### Theory
Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format. Sorting algorithm specifies the way to arrange data in a particular order. Most common orders are in numerical or lexicographical order.
Merge algorithms are a family of algorithms that take multiple sorted lists as input and produce a single list as output, containing all the elements of the inputs lists in sorted order.

### ANALYSIS

**Time Complexity**
|   Approach  |   Time complexity   |
|   --------------  |   ----   |
|    1  |   O((log N) * (N) ) |
|    2  |   O((log N)* N * maxAll) |
