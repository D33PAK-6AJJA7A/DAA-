### Theory
Union: the union (denoted by âˆª) of a collection of sets is the set of all elements in the collection.
Sorting is the process of arranging the elements of a set in a fashionable order i.e either in ascending or descending order of the elements of the set.

### ANALYSIS

**Time Complexity**
|   Approach  |   Time complexity   |
|   --------------  |   ----   |
|    1  |   O((maxALL) * (n+m) ) |
|    2  |   O((n+m)*log(n+m)*(n+m)) | 
|    3  |   O(m*log(m)+n*log(n)+ (n+m)* log(n+m)) |
